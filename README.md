# 112 Jetpack Joyride
112 Jetpack Joyride is a game that is based off the classic side-scrolling runner action game Jetpack Joyride. It has the same basic gameplay where the player has to avoid obstacles and other attacks, including laser beams and rockets, as they move forward. The player would be able to collect coins and upgrade packs along the way. There are two types of upgrade packs: the Invincible and the Magnet Suit. Once a player enters the invincible mode, they will bypass all obstacles for a set amount of time. The Magnet Suit allows the player to attract coins and collect them without physically touching them. In this version of the game, additional features are added, including user register and logins, a score board, player purchases, and other features. New users can register with a username and a password that contain only lowercase letters and numbers. Each time they play the game, their progress will be saved and their scores will be recorded. They will also get coins from each game and the amount of coins they get are calculated by scaling their game score. The top three players that have the highest scores can be found on the score board. Before starting a game, players can purchase bullets which would allow them to shoot at obstacles and rockets to cancel them out. When players die, they are given the option to purchase an extra life with their coins and resume the game.
